## Key Workflows (DEPRECATED state — DO NOT USE for new work)

1. **Before implementing:** Check the active replacement at `packages/phenotype-research/`
   in the monorepo. Migrate there before any new feature work.
2. **Quality gates:** Run linters, tests, and docs validation (see CLAUDE.md) — only
   if explicitly authorized by orchestrator.
3. **Worktrees:** Do NOT create new worktrees on this repo. Use the monorepo.
4. **Integration:** Commit to canonical repo (`main`) only after orchestrator pre-approval.
